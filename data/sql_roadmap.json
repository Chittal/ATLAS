        "description": "# What Are Relational Databases?\n\nRelational databases are a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Based on the relational model introduced by E.F. Codd in 1970, they use a structure that allows data to be organized into tables with rows and columns. Key features include:\n\n- Use of SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data\n- Support for ACID transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)\n- Enforcement of data integrity through constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys)\n- Ability to establish relationships between tables, enabling complex queries and data retrieval\n- Scalability and support for multi-user environments\n\nExamples of popular relational database systems include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. They are widely used in various applications, from small-scale projects to large enterprise systems, due to their reliability, consistency, and powerful querying capabilities.",

        "description": "# RDBMS Benefits and Limitations\n\nHere are some of the benefits of using an RDBMS:\n\n- **Structured Data**: RDBMS allows data storage in a structured way, using rows and columns in tables. This makes it easy to manipulate the data using SQL (Structured Query Language), ensuring efficient and flexible usage.\n\n- **ACID Properties**: ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These properties ensure reliable and safe data manipulation in a RDBMS, making it suitable for mission-critical applications.\n\n- **Normalization**: RDBMS supports data normalization, a process that organizes data in a way that reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity.\n\n- **Scalability**: RDBMSs generally provide good scalability options, allowing for the addition of more storage or computational resources as the data and workload grow.\n\n- **Data Integrity**: RDBMS provides mechanisms like constraints, primary keys, and foreign keys to enforce data integrity and consistency, ensuring that the data is accurate and reliable.\n\n- **Security**: RDBMSs offer various security features such as user authentication, access control, and data encryption to protect sensitive data.\n\nHere are some of the limitations of using an RDBMS:\n\n- **Complexity**: Setting up and managing an RDBMS can be complex, especially for large applications. It requires technical knowledge and skills to manage, tune, and optimize the database.\n\n- **Cost**: RDBMSs can be expensive, both in terms of licensing fees and the computational and storage resources they require.\n\n- **Fixed Schema**: RDBMS follows a rigid schema for data organization, which means any changes to the schema can be time-consuming and complicated.\n\n- **Handling of Unstructured Data**: RDBMSs are not suitable for handling unstructured data like multimedia files, social media posts, and sensor data, as their relational structure is optimized for structured data.\n\n- **Horizontal Scalability**: RDBMSs are not as easily horizontally scalable as NoSQL databases. Scaling horizontally, which involves adding more machines to the system, can be challenging in terms of cost and complexity.",

        "description": "# Introduction\n\nSQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a programming language that is used to communicate with and manage databases. SQL is a standard language for manipulating data held in relational database management systems (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It was first developed in the 1970s by IBM.\n\nSQL consists of several components, each serving their own unique purpose in database communication:\n\n- **Queries:** This is the component that allows you to retrieve data from a database. The SELECT statement is most commonly used for this purpose.\n- **Data Definition Language (DDL):** It lets you create, alter, or delete databases and their related objects like tables, views, etc. Commands include CREATE, ALTER, DROP, and TRUNCATE.\n- **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** It lets you manage data within database objects. These commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.\n- **Data Control Language (DCL):** It includes commands like GRANT and REVOKE, which primarily deal with rights, permissions and other control-level management tasks for the database system.\n\nSQL databases come in a number of forms, such as Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and MySQL. Despite their many differences, all SQL databases utilise the same language commands - SQL.\n\nLearn more about SQL from the following resources:\n\n- [@article@SQL Tutorial - Mode](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/)\n- [@article@SQL Tutorial](https://www.sqltutorial.org/)",

For large systems, this could require a good deal of planning.\n\n## 2. Regular Updates\n\nAlways keep SQL Server patched and updated to gain the benefit of the most recent security updates.\n\n## 3. Complex and Secure Passwords\n\nPasswords should be complex and frequently changed. Alongside the use of `GRANT` and `REVOKE`, this is the front line of defense.\n\n## 4. Limiting Remote Access\n\nIf remote connections to the SQL server are not necessary, it is best to disable it.\n\n## 5. Avoid Using SQL Server Admin Account\n\nYou should avoid using the SQL Server admin account for regular database operations to limit security risk. \n\n## 6. Encrypt Communication\n\nTo protect against data sniffing, all communication between SQL Server and applications should be encrypted.\n\n## 7. Database Backups\n\nRegular database backups are crucial for data integrity if there happens to be a data loss. \n\n## 8. Monitoring and Auditing\n\nRegularly monitor and audit your database operations to keep track of who does what in your database. \n\n## 9. Regular Vulnerability Scanning\n\nUse a vulnerability scanner to assess the security posture of your SQL.\n\n## 10. SQL Injection\n\nSQL injection can be reduced by using parameterized queries or prepared statements.",

        "description": "# Dynamic SQL\n\nDynamic SQL is a programming method that allows you to build SQL statements dynamically at runtime. It allows you to create more flexible and adaptable applications because you can manipulate the SQL statements on the fly, in response to inputs or changing conditions.\n\nConsider an application where a user can choose multiple search conditions from a range of choices. You might not know how many conditions the user will choose, or what they'll be until runtime. With static SQL, you would have to include a large number of potential search conditions in your WHERE clause. With dynamic SQL, you can build the search string based on the user's actual choices. Note that while the use of Dynamic SQL offers greater flexibility, it also comes with potential security risks such as SQL Injection, and should be used judiciously. Always validate and sanitize inputs when building dynamic queries.",

Unlike the `ROW_NUMBER` function, `RANK` allows for the possibility of ties—rows with equal values in the ordering column(s) receive the same rank, and the next rank is skipped accordingly. For example, if two rows share the same rank of 1, the next rank will be 3. This function is useful for scenarios where you need to identify relative positions within groups, such as ranking employees by salary within each department.",
