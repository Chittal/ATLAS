In 1996, about a year later after the release, NetScape decided to rename it to JavaScript with hopes of capitalizing on the Java community (although JavaScript did not have any relationship with Java) and released Netscape 2.0 with the official support of JavaScript.",

The scope of a variable depends on the keyword that was used to declare it.\n\nThe three types of Scope are Global Scope, Function Scope, and Block Scope. Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope with the `var` keyword. ES6 introduced `let` and `const` which allow Block Scope in JavaScript.\n\nGlobal Scope: Variables declared outside any function or curly braces '{}' have Global Scope, and can be accessed from anywhere within the same Javascript code. `var`, `let` and `const` all provide this Scope.\n\nFunction Scope: Variables declared within a function can only be used within that same function. Outside that function, they are undefined. `var`, `let` and `const` all provide this Scope.\n\nBlock Scope: A block is any part of JavaScript code bounded by '{}'. Variables declared within a block can not be accessed outside that block. This Scope is only provided by the `let` and `const` keywords. If you declare a variable within a block using the `var` keyword, it will NOT have Block Scope.\n\nLocal Scope: Local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions. Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed. `var`, `let` and `const` all provide this Scope.",

There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate. The expression `x = 7` is an example of the first type. This expression uses the `=` operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to 7. The expression `3 + 4` is an example of the second type. This expression uses the `+` operator to add `3` and `4` together and produces a value, `7`. However, if it's not eventually part of a bigger construct (for example, a variable declaration like `const z = 3 + 4`), its result will be immediately discarded `—` this is usually a programmer mistake because the evaluation doesn't produce any effects. As the examples above also illustrate, all complex expressions are joined by operators, such as `=` and `+`.",

For example:\n\n- Making HTTP requests using `fetch()`\n- Accessing a user's camera or microphone using `getUserMedia()`\n- Asking a user to select files using `showOpenFilePicker()`\n\nSo even though you may not have to implement your own asynchronous functions very often, you are very likely to need to use them correctly.",
