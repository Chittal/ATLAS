It acts on behalf of the servers, providing benefits such as load balancing, caching, SSL termination, and security. Reverse proxies can distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and reliability, cache frequently requested content to reduce server load, handle SSL encryption and decryption to offload this task from backend servers, and provide an additional layer of security by hiding server details. Common uses include improving web application performance, enabling microservices architectures, and enhancing security in web hosting environments.

It operates on a client-server model, typically using separate control and data connections between the client and server. FTP allows users to upload, download, and manage files on remote systems, supporting both authenticated and anonymous access. While widely used for its simplicity and compatibility, FTP has security limitations as it transmits data and credentials in plain text. As a result, more secure alternatives like SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) and FTPS (FTP Secure) have gained popularity for sensitive data transfers. Despite its age, FTP remains in use for various file transfer needs, especially in legacy systems and where security is less critical. \n\nSFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a secure file transfer protocol that provides file access, transfer, and management functionalities over a secure shell (SSH) data stream. It's designed as an extension of SSH to offer secure file transfer capabilities. SFTP encrypts both commands and data in transit, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Unlike traditional FTP, SFTP uses a single connection and doesn't separate control and data channels. It supports features like resuming interrupted transfers, directory listings, and remote file removal. SFTP is widely used in enterprise environments for secure file transfers, automated scripts, and as a more secure alternative to FTP. Its integration with SSH makes it a preferred choice for system administrators and developers working with remote systems securely.",

Anything not on the whitelist is denied by default. Whitelisting offers a high level of security by limiting access to only known and approved entities, but it can be inflexible and require frequent updates to accommodate legitimate changes. Greylisting is a more flexible approach used primarily in email filtering. When an email is received from an unknown sender, the server temporarily rejects it with a \"try again later\" response. Legitimate mail servers will retry sending the email after a short delay, while spammers, which often do not retry, are blocked. This method reduces spam by taking advantage of the fact that spammers usually do not follow retry mechanisms. Greylisting can be less intrusive than whitelisting, but it may introduce slight delays in email delivery for first-time senders.",

Developed by Yahoo, it was a precursor to DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail). DomainKeys uses public key cryptography to allow email systems to verify that a message was sent by an authorized sender and hasn't been tampered with in transit. The sending server signs outgoing emails with a private key, and receiving servers can verify the signature using a public key published in the sender's DNS records. While largely superseded by DKIM, DomainKeys played a crucial role in the evolution of email authentication techniques aimed at combating email spoofing and phishing attacks.",

Each layer serves a specific purpose in the process of data communication, with lower layers handling more hardware-oriented tasks and upper layers dealing with software and user-interface aspects. The model helps in understanding how data moves through a network, troubleshooting network issues, and designing network protocols and hardware. While not strictly adhered to in real-world implementations, the OSI model remains a valuable educational tool and reference point for network engineers and developers, providing a common language for discussing network operations and architecture.",

Chef \"Recipes\" are written in Ruby, in a primarily declarative style. Chef requires that a client is installed on a server being managed. This client polls a Chef-Server regularly, to determine what its configuration should be. Chef-Solo is also available, a version of Chef that allows provisioning of a single node by running chef locally. A key tenet of Chef recipe design is the concept of idempotence. All Chef recipes should be runnable multiple times and produce the same result - this is especially necessary in cases where the client/server model listed above is in use. This pattern of configuration management is highly influential for future declarative tools like Terraform and Cloud Formation.",

Developed by Bitnami, it addresses the challenge of managing sensitive information in Git-based workflows and cluster management. The controller running in the cluster decrypts SealedSecrets into regular Secrets, ensuring that the original, sensitive data never leaves the cluster. This approach enables secure, declarative management of secrets in Kubernetes environments, aligning with GitOps practices. Sealed Secrets uses asymmetric cryptography, where only the controller in the cluster has the private key to decrypt the secrets. This tool enhances security in Kubernetes deployments by allowing secrets to be version-controlled and managed alongside other Kubernetes resources without exposing sensitive data.",

It's designed to monitor and troubleshoot microservices-based distributed systems. Jaeger helps to track requests as they flow through complex distributed systems, identifying performance bottlenecks and understanding system behavior. It supports OpenTracing standards, allowing for vendor-neutral instrumentation of applications. Jaeger features include distributed context propagation, dependency analysis, and root cause analysis. It offers a web UI for visualizing traces and a flexible architecture supporting various storage backends. Jaeger is particularly useful in cloud-native environments, helping developers and operators understand latency issues, optimize performance, and debug problems in microservices architectures.",

OpenTelemetry simplifies the implementation of observability across different languages and platforms, enabling developers to instrument their code once and send data to multiple backends. It supports automatic instrumentation for many popular frameworks and libraries, reducing the effort required to add observability to applications.
