        "description": "# Pick a Language\n\nYou need to pick a programming language to learn the Computer Science concepts. My personal recommendation would be to pick C++ or C and the reason for that is:\n\n- They allow you to deal with pointers and memory allocation/deallocation, so you feel the data structures and algorithms in your bones. In higher level languages like Python or Java, these are hidden from you. In day to day work, that's terrific, but when you're learning how these low-level data structures are built, it's great to feel close to the metal.\n- You will be able to find a lot of resources for the topics listed in this roadmap using C or C++. You can find a lot of resources for Python and Java, but they are not as abundant as C++ and C.\n\nGiven below is the list of resources; pick ones relevant to the language of your choice.",

In complexity theory, a Complexity Class is a set of problems with related complexity. These classes help scientists to groups problems based on how much time and space they require to solve problems and verify the solutions.

It is more rigidly balanced than red–black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval.

Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications, but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures which provide worst-case guarantees; for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red–black trees, and the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses red–black trees.

This makes the database more flexible by eliminating issues stemming from database modifications.\n\nDenormalization is the opposite of normalization.

The selection of a process is based on a particular scheduling algorithm. The scheduling algorithm is chosen depending on the type of system and the requirements of the processes.\n\nHere is the list of some of the most commonly used scheduling algorithms:\n\n- **First Come First Serve (FCFS):** The process that arrives first is allocated the CPU first. It is a non-preemptive algorithm.\n- **Shortest Job First (SJF):** The process with the smallest execution time is allocated the CPU first. It is a non-preemptive algorithm.\n- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF):** The process with the smallest remaining execution time is allocated the CPU first. It is a preemptive algorithm.\n- **Round Robin (RR):** The process is allocated the CPU for a fixed time slice. The time slice is usually 10 milliseconds. It is a preemptive algorithm.\n- **Priority Scheduling:** The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. It is a preemptive algorithm.\n- **Multi-level Queue Scheduling:** The processes are divided into different queues based on their priority. The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. It is a preemptive algorithm.\n- **Multi-level Feedback Queue Scheduling:** The processes are divided into different queues based on their priority. The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. If a process is preempted, it is moved to the next queue. It is a preemptive algorithm.\n- **Highest Response Ratio Next(HRRN):** CPU is allotted to the next process which has the highest response ratio and not to the process having less burst time. It is a Non-Preemptive algorithm.\n- **Lottery Scheduling:** The process is allocated the CPU based on a lottery system. It is a preemptive algorithm.",
