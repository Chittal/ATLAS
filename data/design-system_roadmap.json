This area is usually located at the bottom of the modal container.\n- **Close Action:** Modals should provide a clear way to be closed as they’re blocking content when open. This may be either a separate close button or one of the supplementary actions.\n- **Information Structure:** Even though modals can be used as an empty container for the content, they need a defined information structure to provide a holistic experience. It may include defining how titles and subtitles look by default or where an action element’s area is.\n- **Keyboard Navigation Support:** It should be possible to close a modal by pressing the Esc key and all the focusable elements inside the modal container should be accessible with keyboard navigation.\n- **Focus Trapping:** Once a modal is opened, the focus should be moved to the first element inside the modal and should be looped within the modal container. Closing the modal should return the focus to the last focused element on the page.",

For such scenarios, it’s better to support a variant where the button’s area is divided equally.\n- **Keyboard Navigation:** All tab buttons should be focusable and navigation between the tab’s component should be accessible from the keyboard.\n- **Responsiveness:** If all tabs on mobile don’t fit into the viewport, users should still have access to all tab buttons. Ways to solve this can be making the button area scrollable for mobile or showing a More button containing a dropdown with the rest of the buttons.",

It’s good practice not to show all the messages at the same time.\n- **Accessibility:** Toast messages should be announced by the voice assistive technology and their action should be easily accessible from the keyboard.\n- **Responsivenss:** Toasts should be aligned with the mobile viewport and their action should be easily reachable for tapping.",
