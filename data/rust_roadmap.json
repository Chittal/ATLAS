The `if` and `else` structures are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. Similar to other languages, `while` and `for` are used for looping over a block of code. The `while` loop repeats a block of code until the condition is false, and the `for` loop is used to iterate over a collection of values, such as an array or a range. The `loop` keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop. Rust's `match` structure, which is similar to switch statements in other languages, is a powerful tool used for pattern matching: it checks through different cases defined by the programmer and executes the block where the match is found. The `if let` syntax lets you combine `if` and `let` into a less verbose way to handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest.\n\nLearn more from the following links:\n\n- [@official@Control Flow](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html)\n- [@article@Concise Control Flow with `if let`](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch06-03-if-let.html)\n- [@article@Mastering Control Flow in Rust](https://dev.to/iamdipankarpaul/mastering-control-flow-in-rust-36fd)",

Essentially, anything with a certain `trait` applied to it will \"inherit\" the behavior of that trait's methods, but this is not the same thing as inheritance found in object-oriented programming languages.\n\nTraits are abstract; it's not possible to create instances of traits. However, we can define pointers of trait types, and these can hold any data type that implements the `trait`. A `trait` is **implemented** for something else with the syntax `impl TraitAbc for Xyz {...}`, which can be a concrete type or another trait.",

If you want your data type or trait to have methods, you need a corresponding `impl` block containing functions for the type or trait.\n\nNote that `self` and `Self` have different meanings in the context of an `impl` block's functions. `self` represents the specific value in your program that's calling the method and passing itself as an argument, while `Self` is syntax sugar for the `impl` block's data type, which is commonly used in constructor methods that return a new instance of the type.",

RustDoc then processes these comments to produce static HTML pages, making it easy for others (and your future self) to understand how to use your libraries and applications. This integrated approach not only promotes good documentation habits but also ensures that the documentation remains in sync with the codebase.",
